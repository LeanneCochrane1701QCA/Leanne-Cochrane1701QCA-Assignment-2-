This project is related to mine because it has a mechanically element, it plays music and has lights plus it is definitely a surprise in a box.  I seriously thought of doing something similar and may yet do this at some stage in the future.

*Microbit: A Password to open a door*

This project is related to mine because it uses the microbit as a keypad for the code to get into the box, I really wanted to include a code on my box and explored this quite a lot but just couldn't work out how to get the music, lights and code all to work together without purchasing multiple extra parts this was also the focus of my Design Concept 2. If I get time later in the production of the project and can work out how to incorporate this as well, I definitely will.

This project is related to mine because it is using the microbit to create an element of surprise in the project, which is what I am hoping to achieve with my project. I was tempted to do something like this which also is related to the first project above but the code etc.. and the different sensors that I would need, meant trying to find a cheaper way around needing to purchase the micro:bit accessories. This would mean perhaps learning a bit about Arduino which seems a little cheaper and more accessible locally for me. I am not sure I am ready to learn this side of things yet but definitely see the potential in this as time goes on.  I'm sure this could be made cheaper though and without the extension parts and will keep it in mind for if my project is a complete failure, which I'm sure it won't.*.

This project is related to mine because it is in a box and plays music, it is a much more simplified version of what I am trying to achieve but is where I will start with the code for the box.

This project is related to mine because it is using some mechanical parts, the micro:bit and the servo motor. I will definitely be needing some mechanical parts and it is good to see how other people manage these.  The microbit will be a big part of my project and as I am toying with the idea of using a servo motor, it is helpful to see it in action.

This project is related to mine because again it is quite mechanical. I love the way he uses foil and wire to manage his project, makes use of the servo motor and microbit in a different way.

## Other research ##
*Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it. The amount of research I have done thus far for this project is unbelievable, there is so much stuff out there, alot to learn and it is all so exciting.  I have definitely found a couple of really helpful sights and some of them don't even speak English. *

### *Brief resource name/description* ###

Hay Kel – youtube videos
*https://www.youtube.com/user/kayebti/videos*

*Provide a link, reference, or whatever is required for somebody else to find the resource. Then provide a few comments about what you have drawn from the resource.*

## Conceptual progress ##

### Design intent ###
*To create a toy or music box that makes music and displays a light when touched or by motion.*

### Design concept 1 ###
*Outline three design concepts, each developed to a point where you anticipate it would be feasible to complete by the end of the course. Each should have a summary of the idea, a rough sketch of what it might be like, and any other notes you created while exploring the idea.* 

*Put the first two design concepts in the sections "Design concept 1" and "Design concept 2". Then put the third, with more development in the section "Final design concept".*

### Design concept 2 ###
*A box that you put a code in to open and once you get the code right and open it, it plays music and lights up, if you get the code wrong it sets an alarm off. *

### Final design concept ###
*This more fully developed concept should include consideration of the interaction scheme, technical functionality, fabrication approach, materials to be used, and aesthetic. A keepsake wooden box, that has a diorama of a little house in it, with maybe a Xmas scene happening outside, you wind up the house to the top of the box and once up the top, it plays xmas carols and the coloured lights flash.  You can either leave it up and play it again or you can wind it down ready for the next person to have a look. I am going to make it shoe box size or maybe a little bigger, at this stage I will be using a combination of balsa *

### Interaction flowchart ###
*Draw a draft flowchart of what you anticipate the interaction process in your project to be. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Physical experimentation documentation ##

*In this section, show your progress including whichever of the following are appropriate for your project at this point.
a.	Technical development. Could be code screenshots, pictures of electronics and hardware testing, video of tests. 
b.	Fabrication. Physical models, rough prototypes, sketches, diagrams of form, material considerations, mood boards, etc.
Ensure you include comments about the choices you've made along the way.*

*You will probably have a range of images and screenshots. Any test videos should be uploaded to YouTube or other publicly accessible site and a link provided here.*

## Design process discussion ##
*Discuss your process in getting to this point, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process.*

## Next steps ##
*Write a list or provide other information about your plan to move the project forward to be ready to present by video and documentation in week 12 of the course.*
